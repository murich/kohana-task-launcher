# Kohana 3.3 Miniond Task Launcher

The idea is to give Kohana application control of what tasks to run, stop and restart.

# Use cases

- Task instances and params depends on website administrator decision.
- Task code was updated and task need to be gently halted and restarted
- 1st time deployment - no need to launch all tasks in manual way

# ToDo

- honestly task stopping is not implemented yet so not all use cases are covered.
